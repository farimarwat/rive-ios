## Rive overview

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a real-time interactive design and animation tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations anywhere. Designers and developers use our collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs. Our lightweight open-source runtime libraries allow them to load their animations into apps, games, and websites.

## Getting started

To get started with Rive Apple runtime, check out the following resources:

- [Getting Started with the Rive Apple runtime](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/apple/apple)

For more information, see the Runtime sections of the Rive help documentation:

- [Animation Playback](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/animation-playback)
- [Layout](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/layout)
- [State Machines](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/state-machines)
- [Rive Text](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/text)
- [Rive Events](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/rive-events)
- [Loading Assets](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/loading-assets)
- [Data Binding](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/data-binding)

## Supported platforms

Supported platforms include iOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS. For the minimum supported versions, see [Package.swift](./Package.swift).

## Examples

Check out the `Example-iOS/` folder for code examples on how to use the Rive Apple runtime.

Open `RiveRuntime.xcworkspace` in Xcode and ensure the selected scheme is set to `Preview (iOS)` or `Preview (macOS)`, based on what platform you want to preview. These schemes make use of the Swift Package Manager package of the Rive Apple runtime, and are the schemes you should use to preview the Rive examples.

**Note**: The other targets are for local development and require additional configuration and set-up. See [Customizing the build schemes for a project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project) for instructions to switch schemes, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. You should not use these schemes unless you are making changes to the underlying C++ runtime.

The example showcases a number of ways to use the high-level `RiveViewModel` API through UIKit and SwiftUI examples, including:

- Setting a Rive file via a URL or asset in the bundle
- Setting layout and loop mode options
- Displaying single or multiple animations / artboards on one component
- Setting up and maniuplating a state machine via inputs
- ...and more!
